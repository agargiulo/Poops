Parser Of On-campus Preferred Specials a.k.a. Poops

This is a web scraper and command prompt interface to tell you what each of the
restaurants on-campus at the Rochester Institute of Technology.  Currently, it
is only usable by members of Computer Science House on the user machines, but
my long-term plan is to make a web interface for it so that everyone can find
out what is being served.
