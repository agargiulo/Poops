Parser Of On-campus Specials a.k.a. Poops

This is a web scraper and command prompt interface written in python to tell
you what is being served at RIT restaurants.  This was originally intended to
only be used by members of Computer Science House at the Rochester Institute of
Technology, but my long-term plan is to make a web interface so that it is
available to everyone.
